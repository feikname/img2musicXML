# img2musicXML
Easily transcribe sheets in image format to MusicXML (WIP)

# Objective
The objective of this tool is to be used when automatic converters fail to work.

# How it works
You just draw over your inputted image and when done, click "Export".

# Features
This tool was made to work where automatic converters don't:
 * Draw every element on top of a image (you can adjust the opacity)
 * Draw "invisible elements" (elements not included in the image but you wish to add)
 * Works for poor quality images as long as **you** can see the lines and notes.
 * Works well with hand-written sheets
 * Works with staffs in diagonal and/or with irregular lines
 * ~Rotate images inside the tool~ (won't be available in v0.1-Alpha)


Although it won't work in advanced sheets for now, it covers most basic needs.

More features will be added in the future.
